# AssemblyAI_Audio_Project

Assembly AI is a service that uses AI models for audio transcription. While this is a paid service, they have some free tools available for use. You can try it out on their webiste at: https://www.assemblyai.com/playground/source.

For this project I used the Aseembly AI API to analyze the audio content of a short podcast episode (there's a limit to how much transciption you get for free). I then created a dashboard to explore the audio content using Panel in Python.
